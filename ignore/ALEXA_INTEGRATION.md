# Alexa Integration Guide for Billy Bass

This document outlines the plan and implementation details for integrating the Big Mouth Billy Bass with Amazon Alexa.

## Overview

The goal is to make Billy Bass respond to Alexa voice commands and speak Alexa's responses through synchronized mouth and body movements. This creates an entertaining physical embodiment of Alexa.

## Integration Methods

There are two primary approaches to Alexa integration:

### 1. Audio-Only Method (Current Implementation)

The current implementation uses audio detection to trigger Billy's movements:

- Connect Alexa's audio output to the Arduino's analog input (A0)
- When Alexa speaks, the audio signal triggers Billy's mouth and body movements
- No direct communication with Alexa's API is required
- Simple to implement but limited in functionality

**Setup Requirements:**
- Audio connection from Alexa device to Arduino
- Proper audio level adjustment to match the `silence` threshold
- Optional amplifier circuit if audio signal is too weak

### 2. Direct API Integration (Future Enhancement)

For more advanced functionality, direct integration with Alexa's API would allow:

- Custom wake word (e.g., "Hey Billy")
- Synchronized animations with specific commands
- Custom responses and behaviors
- LED effects coordinated with responses

**Implementation Options:**

#### a. Alexa Voice Service (AVS) Integration
- Use a Raspberry Pi or ESP32 instead of Arduino
- Implement the AVS client on the microcontroller
- Communicate with Arduino for motor control
- Requires more complex hardware and software setup

#### b. Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) Integration
- Create a custom Alexa Skill
- Use AWS Lambda functions to process commands
- Communicate with the Arduino via a bridge device (Raspberry Pi/ESP32)
- Allows for custom commands specific to Billy Bass

## Hardware Requirements for Enhanced Integration

For direct API integration, the following additional hardware would be needed:

- Raspberry Pi or ESP32 (for running Alexa client software)
- Microphone array (for voice detection)
- Speaker (for audio output)
- Optional: LEDs for visual feedback
- Optional: Bluetooth module for wireless communication

## Software Architecture

A proposed software architecture for direct API integration:

1. **Voice Processing Layer**
   - Handles wake word detection
   - Processes voice commands
   - Communicates with Alexa services

2. **Control Layer**
   - Interprets Alexa responses
   - Determines appropriate animations
   - Sends commands to the Animation Layer

3. **Animation Layer**
   - Controls motors based on audio and commands
   - Manages timing of movements
   - Handles special animations for specific commands

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Audio-Only Integration (Current)
- [x] Implement basic audio detection
- [x] Create mouth synchronization with audio
- [x] Add random body movements
- [ ] Fine-tune audio threshold for optimal response
- [ ] Add audio amplifier circuit if needed

### Phase 2: Enhanced Audio Integration
- [ ] Add audio frequency analysis for better mouth sync
- [ ] Create different movement patterns based on audio characteristics
- [ ] Implement "idle" animations when waiting for commands

### Phase 3: Direct API Integration
- [ ] Set up Raspberry Pi/ESP32 with Alexa client
- [ ] Create communication protocol between Alexa client and Arduino
- [ ] Implement custom wake word detection
- [ ] Develop special animations for specific commands

### Phase 4: Custom Alexa Skill
- [ ] Create Billy Bass Alexa Skill
- [ ] Implement custom commands (e.g., "Tell Billy to sing")
- [ ] Add special responses and easter eggs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues with Audio Integration

- **No response to audio**: Check audio connection and adjust silence threshold
- **Mouth constantly moving**: Silence threshold too low, increase the value
- **Delayed response**: Reduce processing in the loop or optimize code
- **Erratic movements**: Check motor connections and power supply

### API Integration Issues

- **Authentication failures**: Check Alexa developer credentials
- **Connection timeouts**: Verify network connectivity
- **High latency**: Optimize communication between devices
