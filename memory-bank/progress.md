# Progress: Billy Bass Control System

## Completed Features

- Basic motor control system
- Serial command interface
- Movement calibration system
- Direct motor control
- Command conflict resolution
- Updated help system

## In Progress

- Testing new motor control
- Verifying calibration commands
- Validating movement timing
- Testing audio reactivity

## Backlog

- Save calibration settings to EEPROM
- Additional movement patterns
- Enhanced audio response
- Testing framework

## Known Issues

1. **Previous Issues Resolved**:
   - Removed safety checks that were blocking movements
   - Fixed command conflict between 'm' commands
   - Simplified motor control logic

2. **Current Status**:
   - New calibration system needs testing
   - Movement timing needs verification
   - Speed settings need optimization

## Recent Changes

- Removed safety check system
- Changed manual mode toggle to 'l'
- Added calibration commands:
  - 't' for mouth timing
  - 'y' for body timing
  - 'm' for mouth speed
  - 'n' for body speed
  - 'p' to print settings

## Next Steps

1. Test Movement System
   - Basic movements (o,c,f,b)
   - Reset function (r)
   - Movement timing
   - Speed control

2. Verify Calibration
   - Test timing commands
   - Test speed commands
   - Document optimal values

3. Test Modes
   - Manual/auto toggle
   - Audio reactivity
   - Debug output

## Testing Status

- Basic movement commands: Ready for testing
- Calibration commands: Ready for testing
- Mode toggles: Ready for testing
- Audio reactivity: Needs verification

## Configuration Status

```cpp
// Default Settings
MovementCalibration {
    mouthOpenTime: 400ms
    mouthCloseTime: 400ms
    bodyForwardTime: 600ms
    bodyBackTime: 600ms
    mouthSpeed: 150
    bodySpeed: 120
}

// Movement Limits
MAX_MOVEMENT_TIME: 1000ms
MAX_SPEED: 180
```

## Documentation Status

- README: Updated
- Memory Bank: Current
- Command reference: Updated
- Debug messages: Implemented

## Testing Instructions

1. Basic Movement Test:
   ```
   o -> c  : Test mouth
   f -> b  : Test body
   r      : Test reset
   ```

2. Calibration Test:
   ```
   p      : View settings
   t      : Set mouth timing
   y      : Set body timing
   m      : Set mouth speed
   n      : Set body speed
   ```

3. Mode Test:
   ```
   l      : Manual/auto
   a      : Audio mode
   d      : Debug mode
   ```
